# Game Engine Personal Reference

## Introduction

This is my adaptation from the [ThinMatrix OpenGL 3D Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E) from YouTube. It uses LWJGL 2 (there is a 3rd version available); however, this project is meant to introduce myself into the basics of the framework. Some 3D models will be developed by my sister with Blender. This project is not finished; and, it has mainly personal reference purposes. 

## Contributions

This project is not meant to be massively developed. The main purpose is to familiarize myself with the game engine. However, if it helps as reference for someone else, it is free to access.

## Installation

To see the source code you may download the project and import it to **eclipse** as any other Java Project. The main class is located at `engineTester.MainGameLoop` class.

## Other materials

Before this tutorial, the [RealTutsGML Java Game Programming Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXT11ZbB2Mk&list=PLWms45O3n--54U-22GDqKMRGlXROOZtMx) was a very usefull introduction to videogames development to me.

*Happy coding.*
